# Stopless-Intersection-Simulator

This program is designed to simulate a simple traffic intersection. The purpose of this simulator is to test the idea of a stopless intersection. In this simulation, it uses vehicle to infrastructure technology. 

The data files provided are used to randomly create "cars" that have different starting locations and speeds
Once the program runs, you should see a intersection with circles going through the center. There is also a box to represent the the range that the infrastructure can reach. Once a car enters this zone, it turns red, indicating "danger mode".

The different colors meaning
Red: Danger Zone
Green: Safe Zone
Blue: Collision occured with this vehicle
